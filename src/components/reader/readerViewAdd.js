                                                <p>Frankly, <strong><a href="https://www.escils.com/p/linkedin-course" target="_self">LinkedIn Marketing</a></strong> is considered a backbone in social media marketing.
                            </p>
                                                <div>We usually don’t have our push notifications on and I don’t check out what’s happening on in there even half as often as Twitter (which, for us, is about 1/10th as frequently as Facebook
                            </div>
                                                <div>Though, the social medium made some important developments in last year. In fact, we are really looking forward to using it more in 2019. Amazing, we know!
                            </div>
                                                <p>LinkedIn has got bigger updates to Groups, rolled out natural video functionality for organization business pages, launched a Vimeo integration, and have even initiated dipping their toes into Stories.
                            </p>
                                                <div>So, with all that inattention, we wished to create a strategy for our 2019 LinkedIn marketing campaigns.
                            </div>
                                                <p>We asked a few of my contacts to whom we look for LinkedIn advice for some instructions because we had an idea to know they get great engagement on their routine posts.

                                                    <br /><strong>Related Course: </strong><strong><a href="https://www.escils.com/p/linkedin-course" target="_self">https://www.escils.com/p/linkedin-course</a></strong>
                                                    <br />
                                                    <br />So, we decided to let you know that we studied about LinkedIn marketing.
                                <br />
                                                </p>
                                                <h2>1) Write More Innovatively</h2>
                                                <p>
                                                    <br />You must have an idea that you have 1,300 characters obtainable to you on an individual LinkedIn post. It turns out, at least in this case, longer is the perfect practice. But, add some interesting elements that engage your audience.
                                <br />
                                                </p>
                                                <div>In fact, few people have stated their long-form updates receive 10 times more prominence than a short post or link to an article
                            </div>
                                                <h2>2) Tag Relevant People in LinkedIn Posts</h2>
                                                <p>
                                                    <br />When you’ve arranged the perfect post that delivers value to your readers it’s time to tag relevant people!
                            </p>
                                                <div>When you tag some persons in a LinkedIn post, their connections and people who follow them will also be able to observe that content. When a few people engage with the post it’s also observed and reached by those people’s followers and the same connections.
                            </div>
                                                <h2>3) Use Hashtags</h2>
                                                <p>
                                                    <br />LinkedIn users can follow a relevant hashtag to get content on that subject in their news feed even if they don’t follow particular influencers for that subject.
                            </p>
                                                <div>You may have seen LinkedIn now auto-suggests hashtags whenever you update your status or upload picture or video.
                            </div>
                                                <div>At an initial stage, their reference engine leaves a lot to be desired. I tend to observe hashtags suggested by LinkedIn that are very comprehensive or have very little, if something, to do with what my post is all about.
                            </div>
                                                <h2>4) Upload Native Video</h2>
                                                <p>
                                                    <br />In case you’ve been stuck on a deserted island for the past year, permit us to let you know: video is vital.
                            </p>
                                                <p>Same as the most other social platforms that wish to keep you on their network for as long as conceivable, LinkedIn helps native video over links to outside videos.
                            </p>
                                                <p>Remember, native video means uploading a video file straight to the platform as different to simply sharing the link to a video which is hosted anywhere else, such as YouTube and Dailymotion.
                            </p>
                                                <h2>5) Create business Influencers Not only Your Business Profile</h2>
                                                <p>
                                                    <br />When LinkedIn business pages show up in search, Google previews up to 156 characters from your business account. While having a fully-optimized business profile page is significant, you have to go beyond just posting as your organization to be successful.
                            </p>
                                                <p>People wish to follow and connect with other people - not just business accounts.
                            </p>
                                                <h2>6) Stay Connected with The LinkedIn New Changes</h2>
                                                <p>
                                                    <br />With all the modification that has already come to LinkedIn in the last year, there is too much to keep up with. We ensure to dive into each LinkedIn update and learn about it as much as I can.
